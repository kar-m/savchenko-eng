The structure of the book is as follows:

1. Sections (e.g. Kinematics, Relativity...)

2. Subsections (e.g. Kinematics/Motion at Constant Speed, Dynamics/Newton's Laws)

3. Problems

Each Section, Subsection and Problem have a unique number, which is to be preserved in translation.

Each Subsection is to be translated in a unique, single file containing all the problems in the subsection.

Each Section is to be a folder containing all the Subsections.

All pull requests are to be handled by kar-m and tig-rank.
